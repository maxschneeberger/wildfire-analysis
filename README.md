# Abstract
In recent decades, the frequency and severity of wildfires have increased dramatically, driven by climate change and unsustainable land use practices. This thesis analyzes the spatial expansion of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) in San Diego County, California, between 2001 and 2021 and evaluates its intersection with wildfire risk zones. A hybrid methodology was implemented, combining a WUI extraction workflow based on land use raster data with a wildfire risk mapping framework originally developed by the Portuguese Municipal Commission for the Defense of the Forest Against Fire. To ensure methodological compatibility, a customized matching table was created to align Portuguese land use categories with those used by the U.S. Geological Survey. The study found that WUI areas in San Diego County expanded by approximately 100 km² over the 20-year period, and that roughly 90 km² of WUIs in 2021 are located in zones classified as high or very high wildfire risk. While the WUI delineation approach produced some false positives, these are considered acceptable in light of the need to avoid underestimating exposure. The resulting maps and figures serve as a valuable decision-support tool for land use planning and wildfire mitigation strategies. The findings highlight the urgency of monitoring WUI growth and targeting high-risk areas with adaptive management policies.
