# Abstract
Worldwide, wildfires have increased dramatically in recent years, driven not only by climate change but also by changes in land use. Wildfires not only cause significant financial damage but also have far-reaching consequences for human health and the environment.  While the scientific community agrees that the type of land use has a significant impact on wildfire risk, there is a lack of knowledge about how the change in land use is associated with the increase in wildfires. This study hypothesizes that the expansion of wildland urban interfaces has been a key factor in this trend. To examine this, this research investigates the impacts of land use change on the occurrence, frequency and severity of wildfire damage in San Diego County, California, from 2001 to 2021. Publicly available, historical and current land use data, historical wildfire data, and topographic data will be utilized. ArcGIS Pro will serve as the main software package. The methodologies include raster calculations and the development of literature-based metrics to compare the temporal changes in land use and their impact to fire susceptibility. The research results will be of particular benefit to decision-makers in establishing sensible land-use policies to minimize wildfire risk. The outcomes are presented in the form of cartographic representations, tables and graphics in the context of a scientific paper and a poster presentation.
